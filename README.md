## Description 
This application is an API for a fictionous social network applicaiton. This application uses Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose ODM. This application is ran using Insomnia. Through this project, I learned how to use Moongoose ODM and to set up a model and a schema. In this project, I also seperated the controllers and routes making my code more succinct, doing this was new but I found my code to be alot cleaner once implimented. The most difficult part of this project was matching the given models and schema. This provided insight on making models and schemas based off of a request.  

## Usage 

 The user can use the various CRUD operations to either create a new user, add a friend to that user's friends array. Create a thought, create a reaction to a thought. The user can delete a friend which will modify the friends array associated with the user. Delete a thought or a reaction to a thought. The user can also update a thought or a reaction. 

## Installation 

In order to use this application, clone the repository onto your computer and install the respective dependencies and run on localhost:3001 using Insonmia. 

## Credits 

I recieved help from tutor Meg Meyers. 

I used the email match regex from the class bootcamp modules.
